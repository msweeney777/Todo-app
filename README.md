Testing fonts with *asteriks* or _underscores_.
I also intend to further experiment with emphases like boldened **asteriks** and __underscores__.
Finally I want to experiment with combined emphases with **asteriks and _underscores_**.
Additionally I want to experiment with striking through utilizing two tildes: ~~This example is no longer relevant so I will scratch it out~~

Now for some lists:

1. First ordered list item
2. Second ordered list item
..* Unordered sub-list.
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number.
