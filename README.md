Testing fonts with *asteriks* or _underscores_.
I also intend to further experiment with emphases like boldened **asteriks** and __underscores__.
Finally I want to experiment with combined emphases with **asteriks and _underscores_**.
Additionally I want to experiment with striking through utilizing two tildes: ~~This example is no longer relevant so I will scratch it out~~

Now for some lists:

1. First ordered list item
2. Second ordered list item
  * Unordered sub-list.
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number.
  1. Ordered sub-list
4. Another item..

Now for further expperimental indentation:

   For proper indentation, use the space-bar three times. Also keep in mind that the space between text as in the case above causes a space between text in markdown.
   For a line break without a paragraph, two trailing spaces are needed at the end of a sentence.  Post trailing spaces.  This line is also seperate but still part of the paragraph.

  *By the way, unordered lists can use asterisk

  -Or minuses

  +Or pluses
